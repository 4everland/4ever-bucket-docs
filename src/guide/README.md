## 4EVERLAND BUCKET

Bucket is 4EVERLAND's storage file system, the most convenient and efficient storage product for uploading, pinning, and fetching files on IPFS.
You can utilize 4EVERLAND's SDK, S3, to interact and integrate programmatically, or use the operating system directly to upload, browse, and manage all your files through the interface.
All files have been uploaded to IPFS and can be viewed and referenced using the Bucket URL or the IPFS gateway.
