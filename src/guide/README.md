## 4EVERLAND BUCKET

Bucket is 4EVERLAND's storage file system, the most convenient and efficient storage product for uploading, pinning, and fetching files on IPFS. 

You can utilize 4EVERLAND's SDK, S3, to interact and integrate programmatically, or use the operating system directly to upload, browse, and manage all of your files through the interface.

All files have been uploaded to IPFS and can be viewed and referenced using the Bucket URL or the IPFS gateway.

As a option, we also offer Arweave permanent storage; if you need permanent storage, you can create an AR Bucket, which saves the files to the AR network and allows you to veiw and reference them using AR Hash or AR gateway.
