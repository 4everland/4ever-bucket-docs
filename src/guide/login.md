## Step2: Create Bucket

Click on the 'New Bucket' button in the top left corner, enter a bucket name to create your bucket. The system will give the domain name to your website automatically. Additionally, when creating a bucket, you can choose whether to use the Arweave function, and the files in the bucket will be automatically synchronized to the AR network when the switch is turned on.
